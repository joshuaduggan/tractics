Github Pages is tricky - My current imperfect understanding:
    I use gh-pages which is a node module which can be run from npm to make github update your specified pages site with the current repo state. You want to disable Jeykyll which by default creates a root index.html from the readme.md, you do this by including a ".nojeykyll" file in your project's root. Then I use an index.html file that redirects to ./public to move people to that directory. "public" is the default root output directory of builds.
    "npm run deploy" is the command to get gh-pages to do it's magic. You will need to have a personal access token active for it to access github.

Results table behavior
Oldest: If watch is selected that has more than 1 entry after latest adjustment
this will display the oldest post adjusted record
Prev: If watch is selected that has 1 entry after latest adjustment
this will display the most recent record
Now: As soon as "good sync" is selected this will populate with the current
record
Therefore the first 2 columns of ResTable will have to be updated when a watch
is selected and the 3rd column (and spd of the first 2) when a sync is confirmed
