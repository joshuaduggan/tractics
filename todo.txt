Results table behavior
Oldest: If watch is selected that has more than 1 entry after latest adjustment
this will display the oldest post adjusted record
Prev: If watch is selected that has 1 entry after latest adjustment
this will display the most recent record
Now: As soon as "good sync" is selected this will populate with the current
record
Therefore the first 2 columns of ResTable will have to be updated when a watch
is selected and the 3rd column (and spd of the first 2) when a sync is confirmed
